# fortniteShopBot
I made a discord bot that takes a Fortnite API wrapper in JavaScript, parses the data and sends all the daily and featured shop items in a Discord channel when given a command.

The commands I coded are {help, {daily, {featured, {specialFeatured.
Each command will show the respective section of the Fortnite shop and {help will display the commands that users can type to use the bot.
